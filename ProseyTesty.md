## Testing Prose for Terrain Walking Thing

Working on building simple [terrain walking agents](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s1100074/basicbehavior_3/index.html). Getting agents to walk uphill and downhill is trivial. Recognizing when an agent is stuck can be done by measuring the similarity of angles of subsequent force vectors. When the agent is stuck its direction vectors are often opposite eachother. Like a ball bouncing back and forth between two walls.
